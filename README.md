A simple command line shell for windows.

The NEXShell is made to streamline the looks of your old cmd prompt and add extra functionality!
All you have to do is download the the main repository as a zip and extract all files into System32
Once the files are extracted into System32 you can simply open cmd and run "nexshell"
If installed correctly the shell should open!

If you want to get any updates newer than 1.3 then go to releases and download the latest nexshell update package (.nupd)
use the "update" command in nexshell and point it to the update package, the shell will update to the version of the package.
